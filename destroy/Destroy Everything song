Destroy Everything!!! 

It's the year 2030 A.D. 
Because of global warming, the oceans have warmed (so much)
the heat has awakened ancient creatures 
frozen for million years. 

The cities by the sea, are at constant danger
both from rising waters and angry monsters
that come out of it. 

These monsters are bigger and scarier 
than anything that has ever been seen before.
